    <h3>Step 2: Choose a Charity</h3>
    <p>Visit our ever-growing list of charitable organizations and select the one to which you want to make a regular contribution. Simply click the "Donate" button and AllGive will allow you to choose how much you'd like to contribute and how often. Our system will handle the rest.</p>
    <p>That's all there is to it! You can choose how frequently you'd like emailed reports on your giving, and you can always see how your donations are making a difference by visiting your personal Dashboard page. [links to "My Portfolio" page]</p>
